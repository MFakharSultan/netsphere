So far, we’ve explored what **[networks](../networking)** are and the **[types of networks](../types-of-networks)** that exist. But how are the devices inside a network actually connected to one another?

That’s where network topology comes in.

 A **network topology** is the way devices (or nodes) are arranged and connected in a network. It defines both the physical layout (actual wires, devices) and the logical flow of data.

Just like streets and paths in a city determine how people move, a topology decides how data travels from one device to another in a network.
