Before we talk about networking in computer science, let’s first understand what a network is, in real life.

Networking usually means making and keeping connections with other people to reach certain goals, either at work or in everyday life.

These connections help us get useful information, access resources, or receive support that contributes to personal and professional growth.

A network is a group of things—called nodes—that are connected to each other. These nodes can be people, machines, or even documents. The connections between them are called links, and they show how these things are related or how they communicate.

Let’s look at a simple example: imagine a company with many employees. Each person is a node, and the way they talk to each other, work together, or share ideas are the links. This is a basic idea of how networking works.

## Computer Network

Computer networks work in a similar way to social networks.Just like people connect and share information with each other, computers do the same.

> A network of interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources.

This means computers, phones, or other devices are linked together so they can communicate, send data, and use shared tools like printers, files, or internet connections.

## Summary
In this lesson, we learned that networking is about building connections—whether between people or between computers. Just like people form relationships to share knowledge and support one another, computers connect in computer networks to exchange data and share resources.

We also saw how networks are made up of nodes and links, and how this idea applies both to human networks and digital systems.

Understanding these basic concepts is the first step toward exploring how the internet works, how data travels, and how different types of networks are designed.
